# GrowthTracker

**GrowthTracker** is a MERN stack app that allows users to create an account, deploy a Likert-scale survey, respond to a survey and receive their survey results in percentile rank.

The login authentication is handled by a React form component and sent via a POST request to the server, where it is authenticated with [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) and hashed with [bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs).
